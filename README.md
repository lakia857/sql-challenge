This assignment evaluates the employees of a company. For the assignment, I built databases using Quick DBD to show visual database connections as well as exported the file into pgAdmin where I used queries to analyze data. Some of the data I analyzed includes the employees names, sex, salaries, departments and title to name a few. I evaluated hiring dates and even evaluted how many employees share the same last name using count function.

Here are a couple of queries from the various databases.

This assignment evaluates the employees of a company. For the assignment, I constructed empty databases using Quick DBD to show visual database connections. Then, I exported the file into pgAdmin where I imported the raw data from multiple CSV files to fill in the empty databases. There, I used queries to analyze data. 

Some of the data I analyzed includes the employees’ names, sex, salaries, departments and title to name a few. I evaluated hiring dates and even evaluated how many employees share the same last name using various SQL functions.

Here are a couple of queries from the various databases.
